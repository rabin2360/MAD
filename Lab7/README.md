##Lab 7:
* Create an Android app that uses at least 7 different UI widgets and 2 different layout types(or 1 if you're using a Constraint Layout). Have one of the widgets determine what image is shown in an ImageView(i.e. the spinner value changes the image). Your app should use a launcher icon that is not the default.
